# CI-Decoding-project


This repository contains a collection of notebooks explaining the main codes I used during my lab rotation. The notebooks can be downloaded and opened using jupyter notebook. There is also a version of the notebook in pdf, and an original version of the code in .py format. 

Hopefully this will help on continuing the project smoothly.
