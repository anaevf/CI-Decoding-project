    "# Importing epoch data from Fieldtrip to MNE\n",
    "\n",
    "Importing data from fieldtrip to mne is not a trivial question. MNE has many powerful visualization, decoding and source localization tools that require your data to be in a specific data format (class). \n",
    "\n",
    "The major classes accepted in the MNE toolbox are listed in their website. [There is a good page on the Fieldtrip website explaining how to export data from Fieldtrip to MNE](http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/development/integrate_with_mne), however this is still in development: you can easily export data from fieldtrip to MNE if they are on the format of RAW or EVOKED, but not EPOCHS. Unfortunately for us, the epoched data type is specially interesting as it is the format the data is after being cleaned by fieldtrip.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a long time in my lab rotation, it was really hard for me to import data from fieldtrip to Python in a way I could keep all the important features I wanted (the data, the time window, the fs, etc) and to be adapted to the MNE-workflow. After trying many codes that did not succeed, I finally found someone who had the same problem as mine. I could adapt their codes with what I had tried so far. This is what this tutorial is about: the function load_cor. Importantly, the code used in this tutorial is supposed to run on Windows. A small adaptation of function load_cor was created for mac users.\n",
