These notebooks are mainly tutorials and guides for the major pipeline I developed in the project.

In this folder you will find the notebooks in .ipynb (to be run with the jupyter notebook) and in html format. If you only want to read, I recommend to open the HTML files as they look better to read. If you want to open in jupyter notebook in your pc, you should download the ipynb files.
