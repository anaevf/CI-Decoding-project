These notebooks are mainly tutorials and guides for the major pipeline I developed in the project.

In this folder you will find the notebooks in .ipynb (to be run with the jupyter notebook) and in html format. If you only want to read, I recommend to download the HTML files as the comments I've made throughout the code look better to read. If you want to open in jupyter notebook in your pc, you should download the ipynb files.
